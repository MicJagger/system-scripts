https://wiki.libvirt.org/Networking.html#Forwarding_Incoming_Connections
This script is based on the method shown in the wiki, but reworked to support multiple ports as well as TCP & UDP simultaneously

This script is to port forward a kvm/qemu virtual machine over NAT
The qemu file in this folder is to be modified to have the virtual machine name, its IP, and all ports
It will port forward those ports over both TCP and UDP

# go to the location for the script
cd /etc/libvirt/hooks/

# insert script - - - you could copy it into here instead
sudo nano qemu

# make the file executable
sudo chmod +x qemu

# restart kvm/qemu
sudo systemctl stop libvirtd
sudo systemctl start libvirtd
